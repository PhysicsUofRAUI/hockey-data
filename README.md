# hockey-data
A place for me to collect hockey data for further analysis. It is mostly collected from https://www.hockey-reference.com.

## Player Stats
This folder contains the last 20 years of player stats from https://www.hockey-reference.com.

## play_origins
This has players listed by country of origin and found at https://www.hockey-reference.com.

## Jupyter Notebooks
All analysis I will do will be with jupyter notebooks. A few already exist but it is not anything in depth.
